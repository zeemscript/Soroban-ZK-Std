Closes #9, #12, #17, #20, #21. Major arithmetic milestone for `soroban-zk-core`:

- BN254 base field (`Fq`) and scalar field (`Fr`) arithmetic.
- `Fr` subtraction with modular underflow protection.
- G1Projective Jacobian point addition and doubling.
- Constant-time `g1_scalar_mul` using bitwise `ct_select` — no scalar leakage via timing side-channels.
- Jacobian → Affine coordinate conversion (`to_affine`).
- `ElGamalCiphertext` API synchronised with `shielded-asset-template`.
- 100% passing tests and successful WASM target compilation.
