Closes #12. Implements `g1_scalar_mul` over BN254 G1:

- Constant-time double-and-add scanning all 254 scalar bits.
- `ct_select` eliminates branching on scalar bits.
- Edge-case handling for scalar = 0 (identity) and scalar = 1.
- Test suite: group order identity, multiplicative identity, doubling consistency.
